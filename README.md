Introduction:

This project builds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to automatically classify gender from facial images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled facial images and can be used to predict the gender of new images with high accuracy.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

-OpenCV

-NumPy

-scikit-image

-Matplotlib (optional)

-joblib

-tkinter

Instructions:

Train the model:

-Download a dataset of labeled facial images.

-Process and normalize the data.

-Train the SVM model using the code in train.py.

-Save the trained model to model.sav.

Use the GUI:

-Run demo2.py.
Use the "Open Image" button to select an image for classification.
The predicted gender and probability will be displayed on the image.
Or, use the "Webcam" button to classify gender in real time from the webcam.
3. Use the model in an application:

-Load the saved model into your application.
Use the checking(img) function to classify the gender of a static image.
Or, use the model in a facial recognition system to classify gender in real time.

Benefits:

-Automatic gender classification from facial images with high accuracy.

-Simple to use GUI.

-Can be integrated into other applications.

Applications:

-Identity verification.

-Image classification.

-Social research.

Notes:

Ensure the training dataset is properly prepared and labeled for best results.
The model can be improved by experimenting with different SVM algorithms and adjusting parameters.
